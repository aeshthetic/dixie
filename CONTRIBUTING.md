## Contributing
Thank you so much for contributing to Mali! While pull requests are welcome and encouraged, there are several other ways in which
you can contribute to Mali's development, namely by opening or commenting on issues in order to:
* Request features
* Report bugs
* Give feedback regarding how an issue is being handled
* Ask for better documentation on a specific part of the codebase

Code quality is a priority, but my code is not perfect nor do I expect yours to be. However, when submitting pull requests keep these things in mind:
* Ensure that your code is well commented, and that only descriptions are XML Doc'd (i.e. triple-slashed)
* Try to comply with section 3 of [the F# Component Design Guidelines](http://fsharp.org/specs/component-design-guidelines/#3-guidelines-for-f-facing-libraries)
* If you can test your own code, great! If not, it might get pushed to the testing branch before the master branch until it's been effectively tested
